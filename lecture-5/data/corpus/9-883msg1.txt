third international icsc symposia intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / iia99 . htm soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / soco99 . htm june 1 - 4 , 1999 palazzo ducale genova , italy introduction international symposia intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend encompass short-to - long-term effects advanced information technology , soft computing related ' intelligent technolgies ' application fields industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition machine translation . general aim symposia is address underline existing emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing intelligent technolgies , particular emphasis soft computing . contributions are sought intelligent automation manufacturing emphasis current potential applications , broad interest engineering disciplines , computer science related technology fields . following success iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , third symposium held genova , italy . iia / soco series established themselves platform scientists practitioners academic , governmental industrial institutions discuss developments results field intelligent technologies . further follow-up conference has already been scheduled 2001 paisley , scotland . purpose iia ' 99 soco ' 99 advances soft computing related techniques : theory applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one major technological drivers advancement modern society . nowadays major achievement , related field research , is strongly supported proper ait based tools . often , achievements been possible after proper ait approach has been designed implemented . is widely known ait has strong impact society itself , radically changing skills competencies required order contribute everyday human environment . given nowadays major effort ait development is spent called ' soft - computing ' arena major indeed , surprising , achievements industrial applications application soft-computing techniques , two symposia ( iia ' 99 soco ' 99 ) many common areas interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition image understanding programs two conferences , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 directed toward medium-to - short term , application driven , research area intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward long term research area soft computing order try overcome usual borderline existing between theory application , two symposia are run jointly , organized partial overlap joint sessions common plenary sessions . aim iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . both wide deep view advances ait advancement offered soft-computing technologies . 2 . both industrial academic researcher opportunity discuss together real problems opportunities . 3 . collect ' best practice ' information perform experiments , tests design products processes embedding / using soft-computing technologies . 4 . explicitly actively function ' technology broker ' , giving opportunity become aware problems possible solutions giving possibility finding technological partners joint research / future application programs . topics iia ' 99 iia ' 99 include contributions research area soft computing application , general , related medium-to - short term application driven developments advanced information technology industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis laid industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development / formalization , quantitative qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly areas based list below : ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control diagnostics - computer vision - robotics remote sensing - speech recognition machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics soco ' 99 soco ' 99 include contributions long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) area soft-computing . contributions are sought areas based list below , is indicative . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms intelligent control - pattern recognition image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases information retrieval - educational aspects soft computing special session special session ' intelligent systems control process optimization ' including plenary lecture is sponsored ifs network organized alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location symposia held palazzo ducale , beautiful historic building city centre genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 soco ' 99 are sponsored : -
